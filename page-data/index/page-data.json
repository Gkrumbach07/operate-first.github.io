If we donâ€™t want each environment to be a snowflake, we should be able to extract best practices that are easy to apply to new environments.</p>\n<p>At the Office of the CTO at Red Hat, we can lead the way with <a href=\"https://opendatahub.io/\">Open Data Hub</a> by opening up our operational knowledge to all open source communities to improve the integration and operability from the source.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"/data-science/\">Data Science</a></h2>\n<p>Get started with tutorials and examples for data science on Open Data Hub.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/users/\">Users</a></h2>\n<p>Learn how you can engage with Open Data Hub and access the deployed components.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/operators/\">Operators</a></h2>\n<p>See how we are deploying and operating Open Data Hub</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/blueprints/\">Blueprints</a></h2>\n<p>Apply best practices and tooling to your own projects.</p>\n<h2>Contribute</h2>\n<p>To contribute to the Operate First initiative, seek support or report bugs on the website, please open an issue <a href=\"https://github.com/operate-first/operate-first.github.io/issues\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Operate First for Open Data Hub","description":"Operate First for ODH"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a142140-ee96-54e2-a6de-c2ce73d44cbc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["117426894","3000541721"]}
