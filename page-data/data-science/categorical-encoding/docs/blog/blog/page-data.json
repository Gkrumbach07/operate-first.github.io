Figure 1 summarizes the commonly used encoders for these problems. These variables are particularly challenging because they have no inherent ordering, for e.g., weather can be rainy, sunny, snowy, etc. Encoding to numbers is challenging because we want to avoid distorting the distances between the levels of the variables. In other words, if we encode rainy as 0, sunny as 1, and snowy as 2 then the model will interpret rainy to be closer to sunny than snowy which is not true. A common approach is to use a one-hot encoding scheme. The method works well because all the one-hot vectors are orthogonal to each other preserving the true distances. However, when the cardinality of the variables increases, one-hot encoding explodes the computation. For example, if we have 1000 different types of weather conditions then one-hot would give a 1000 dimension vector. To improve performance, we may choose to reduce dimensions using various forms of matrix decomposition techniques. However, since we cannot go back to the original dimensional space, we lose explainability in this process.

We explored several techniques used in the literature for an example dataset evaluating the pros and cons of each. If the cardinality (number of levels) of nominal categories is less, then one-hot encoding should be preferred as it preserves the distance between the categories. The interpretation of low and high cardinality depends on the domain but high cardinality would imply hundreds of unique category levels. If the cardinality is high, then we have to use the information present in the string of the nominal variable. Word-based encoders like Similarity encoder and online gamma poisson factorization encoder try to extract information from the n-grams (collection of characters) present in the strings. The evidence suggests that they increase the performance of the classifier indicating that they provide meaningful representation. The online gamma factorization encoder also provides an interpretation of the reduced dimensional space which can be useful in unsupervised tasks. In the example application of the method to an anomaly detection problem, we saw how it can be effectively used as input to an isolation forest and then interpreted using the feature names.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"References\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"1\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"http://www.willmcginnis.com/2015/11/29/beyond-one-hot-an-exploration-of-categorical-variables/\"\n  }), \"Binary encoding\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"2\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://booking.ai/dont-be-tricked-by-the-hashing-trick-192a6aae3087\"\n  }), \"Hashing trick\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"3\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLqKepl9rEo&t=473s\"\n  }), \"Hashing explanation\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"4\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606\"\n  }), \"Fasttext encoder\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"5\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/generated/dirty_cat.SimilarityEncoder.html\"\n  }), \"Similarity encoder\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"6\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01860.pdf\"\n  }), \"Online Gamma Poisson Factorization\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"7\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation\"\n  }), \"Latent Dirichlet allocation\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"[\", \"8\", \"]\", \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/tkdd11.pdf\"\n  }), \"Isolation forest\")), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Project Material\"), mdx(\"h4\", null, \"Steps to get you started:\"), mdx(\"ol\", {\n    \"className\": \"pf-c-list\"\n  }, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"Visit \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://jupyterhub.datahub.redhat.com/\"\n  }), \"jupyterhub.datahub.redhat.com\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"Login with your Kerberos ID\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"In this Spawn screen, select s2i-categorical-encoding-notebook:latest, in the memory size select Large ( Memory: 8Gi, CPU 2)\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"Once your server starts, go into the directory named categorical-encoding-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm/demo\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"Run the notebook named demo.ipynb\")), mdx(\"h4\", null, \"How to Contribute / Provide feedback\"), mdx(\"ul\", {\n    \"className\": \"pf-c-list\"\n  }, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Github Repository: \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/categorical-encoding\"\n  }), \"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/categorical-encoding\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"You can open up a PR on the Git Repository highlighting the feature or issue, and we will address it.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"You can also reach out to \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"mailto:shanand@redhat.com\"\n  }), \"shanand@redhat.com\"), \" for any questions.\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Categorical Encoding","description":"Categorical Encoding"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"23091cc8-6ea9-5eba-ad8b-d98a3916d0e5","slug":"docs/blog/blog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["117426894","3000541721","3753692419"]}
